I am a research economist at the Center for Economic Studies at the US Census Bureau. I received my PhD from the Department of Economics at the University of California, Berkeley in May 2022. During my PhD, I was a Graduate Student Researcher at the Energy Institute at Haas and a California Policy Lab Graduate Fellow. 
<br/>
<br/>
I do research on energy use and environmental risks, public goods, and inequality. My <a href="https://evalyubich.com/files/Lyubich_UCBerkeley_JMP.pdf">job market paper</a> examined the role of places in household carbon emissions.
